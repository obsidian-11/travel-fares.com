For any reason, if passengers debit/credit card gets declined by the travel provider/ issuing company, that results in a declined transaction, Travel Fares shall not be held accountable for the same. We do not guarantee fluctuation in the airfare prices during the verification process, in case, the airfare is not there, we will issue a code for your credit card approval. If the transaction is not finished, it may be possible that the approval code might be temporarily credited the price from your given bank account.</p>
