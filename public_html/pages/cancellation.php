          <h1 class="main-heading">Cancellation Policy</h1>
          <ul>
  <li>By making an installment or payment towards your tour package or other services through travel-fares.com, you agree to allow us to continue processing and delivering your required services.</li>
  <li>When reserving a spot with us, you acknowledge and agree to the Trip Tour Provider's cancellation and no-show policy, as well as any additional terms and conditions of the Trip Tour Provider applicable to your trip (including fine print and house rules), for services or products offered by the Trip Tour Provider.</li>
  <li>Hotel reservations are subject to availability, and room rates may change without prior notice.</li>
  <li>In the event that the originally booked lodging is unavailable, Travelio Tourism And Travel Online reserves the right to secure a booking in a similar category based on availability.</li>
  <li>travel-fares.com reserves the right to cancel payments or orders before delivery without stating reasons.</li>
  <li>You may cancel an order within 7 working days of email confirmation from travel-fares.com. However, with your express consent, we will begin delivery immediately.</li>
  <li>Failure to arrive at the venue for a scheduled activity will result in the cancellation of your booking, and we reserve the right to deny any refund requests in such cases.</li>
  <li>Order cancellations will incur a pre-order processing charge of 50 US Dollars per booking.</li>
  <li>Once your booking is approved by Travelio Tourism And Travel, no refunds can be provided, and you must adhere to the written policy.</li>
  <li>Bookings made or confirmed at the United Arab Emirates immigration desk cannot be canceled.</li>
  <li>The company will not be liable for natural disasters, loss of goods, or any related events during the tour.</li>
  <li>Customers must provide return air tickets and visas to travel-fares.com before booking a tour package for a specific country. Failure to do so will result in the booking not being confirmed. If a customer pays for a tour package without prior air ticket and visa bookings, or if they are unable to provide them after payment, the booking must be canceled, and a 20% cancellation fee will apply. The remaining amount will be refunded to the customer's source of payment.</li>
  <li>Additional service insurance is provided by a third party, and in case of a refund, a 25% deduction will be made for pre-processing and payment gateway charges.</li>
  <li>The service will begin at the specified location, disclosed upon confirmation of the tour package reservation. If airport transfer is included, our driver will be waiting at the designated airport area with a name sign. The customer must approach the driver to avail the service. Failure to do so will result in being marked as a "No Show," and no refund will be issued.</li>
  <li>Tour package costs listed on travel-fares.com are subject to change, especially during peak seasons. Our staff will notify you of any changes, and you may need to make an additional payment or adjust your travel dates. Ensuring your booking matches the amount you paid is our priority.</li>
  <li>If there are changes to the travel date, time, flight, or flight number after service confirmation, the customer must notify Travel-fares.com. Failure to do so may result in being marked as a "No Show," and no refund will be issued.</li>
  <li>Tour package bookings can be canceled if the cancellation request is made before the service is reserved and confirmed by Travel-fares.com, and the trip date is more than three days away. A 25% cancellation fee will be withheld, with the remaining amount returned within three to four working days.</li>
  <li>No refund will be given for cancellations made less than 72 hours before the scheduled service time.</li>
  <li>Changes to the service can be made up to 72 hours before the scheduled service time, but additional fees may apply. Changes made less than 72 hours before the scheduled service time will result in a "No Show," and no amendments will be permitted.</li>
  <li>Any denied service, including no-shows, will be charged in full, and no refunds will be issued.</li>
  <li>In case of lost goods or luggage, the client and the driver should communicate to retrieve the goods/luggage. Travel-fares.com disclaims all liability for losses.</li>
